## Versioning

The versioning feature in Bibernate allows for the management of entity data versions, enabling optimistic concurrency control.
This feature is crucial for applications handling concurrent access to data, ensuring data integrity and consistency.



1. Entity Versioning
   Entities in Bibernate can be annotated with a version attribute, which automatically tracks changes to the entity.
   This version attribute is updated whenever the entity is modified.


```java
@Getter
@Setter
@Entity
@Table(name = "employees")
public class EmployeeEntity {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    private String firstName;

    private String lastName;

    @Version
    private Integer version;
}
```

In the above example, the @Version annotation marks the version attribute for versioning.


2. Optimistic Concurrency Control
   Bibernate implements optimistic concurrency control by comparing entity versions during updates. 
   If the version of the entity being updated differs from the version when it was initially fetched, 
   Bibernate throws an exception, indicating a concurrent modification.

## Benefits

**Data Integrity:** Ensures consistency and integrity of data in multi-user applications.
**Concurrency Control:** Effectively manages concurrent access to data, preventing conflicts and ensuring reliable updates.


## Conclusion
The versioning feature in Bibernate provides a robust mechanism for managing entity data versions and implementing optimistic concurrency control. 
By tracking entity versions and detecting concurrent modifications, Bibernate ensures data consistency and integrity, essential for modern application development.
